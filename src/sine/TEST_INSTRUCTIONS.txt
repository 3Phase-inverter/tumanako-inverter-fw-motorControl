Test Instructions (AC Motor, KiwiAC and SKiiP)
----------------------------------------------
These instructions detail how to run an AC induction motor
using a KiwiAC control board (STM32MCU) with stm32_sine software
connected to a SKiiP module.  This currenlty has no controlls
and simply runs the motor at constant speed until the power is
turned off.

1. Wiring
---------

See wiring diagram here: http://sourceforge.net/apps/mediawiki/tumanako/index.php?title=Motor_Control_Sine

a) Connect 26 strand ribbon cable from KiwiAC to SKiiP
b) Provide 24V to the KiwiAC (powers SKiiP via ribbon cable)
c) Provide 12V to KiwiAC (powers KiwiAC)

And don't forget to wire your motor and DC bus power supply to the power stage (SKiiP).

2. Install the program
----------------------
Connect the KiwiAC USART0 port to your development PC with a serial cable.  Suggest you
create a cable with the following modification so it is easy to put the board into Bootloader
mode (http://sourceforge.net/apps/mediawiki/tumanako/index.php?title=STM32MCU_Flashing#Automatic_Reset).

With the board powered up in boot loader mode, run the following command to upload the program
(stm32_sine_test.bin is a pre built and tested  binary which has been committed to SVN, but you can also 
build your from source if desired):

$ stm32loader.py -ewv stm32_sine_test.bin


3. Power Up
-----------

Power up your DC bus to the power stage (24V is enough on a test rig).  Power up the 24V supply to the
STM32MCU so that the SKiiP can power itself up.  Finally, turn the 12V power to the STM32MCU on, you should 
instantly see the blue light, followed by the red light flashing (for some reason this 
sometimes takes about 30 seconds to start flashing?).  The motor should also start 
running straight away.

4. Power Down
-------------
Turn the power off to stop the motor
