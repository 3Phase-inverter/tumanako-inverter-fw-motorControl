Test Instructions (AC Motor, STM32MCU and SKiiP)
------------------------------------------------
These instructions detail how to run an AC induction motor
using a STM32MCU control board (e.g the KiwiAC control board is
an STM32MCU manufactured by Greenstage) with stm32_sine software
connected to a SKiiP module.  This currenlty has no controlls
and simply runs the motor at constant speed until the power is
turned off.

1. Wiring
---------

See wiring diagram here: http://sourceforge.net/apps/mediawiki/tumanako/index.php?title=Motor_Control_Sine
The full STM32MCU pin out is available from SVN in inverter/hw/STM32MCU/STM32MCUsch.pdf
A mapping of STM32MCU IO to STM32 pins is available from SVN in inverter/hw/STM32MCU_IO.ods

a) Connect 26 strand ribbon cable from STM32MCU to SKiiP
b) Provide 24V to the STM32MCU (powers SKiiP via ribbon cable)
c) Provide 12V to STM32MCU (powers STM32MCU)

And don't forget to wire your motor and DC bus power supply to the power stage (SKiiP).

2. Install the program
----------------------
Connect the STM32MCU USART0 port to your development PC with a serial cable.  Suggest you
create a boot loader serial cable so it is easy to put the board into Bootloader
mode, or alternatively bridge pin 1 and 2 of j105.  Instructions for both options are
available here: http://sourceforge.net/apps/mediawiki/tumanako/index.php?title=STM32MCU_Flashing

With the board powered up in boot loader mode, run the following command to upload the program
(stm32_sine_test.bin is a pre built and tested binary which has been committed to SVN, but you can also 
build your own from source if desired, just type 'make', although this also requires libopenstm32):

$ stm32loader.py -ewv stm32_sine_test.bin


3. Power Up
-----------

Power up your DC bus to the power stage (24V is enough on a test rig).  Power up the 24V supply to the
STM32MCU so that the SKiiP can power itself up.  Finally, turn the 12V power to the STM32MCU on, you should 
instantly see the blue light, followed by the red light flashing (for some reason this 
sometimes takes about 30 seconds to start flashing?).  The motor should also start 
running straight away.

4. Power Down
-------------
Turn the power off to stop the motor
